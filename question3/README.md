## Question 3

(K&R Exercise 5-4) Write the function <code>strend(s,t)</code> which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise. **Be sure to use pointers.** Verify that your function works with at least 3 examples.

Compile Steps:

	gcc q3.c -o out3

Output:

	Output 1 (should be 1): 1
	Output 2 (should be 0): 0
	Output 3 (should be 1): 1
